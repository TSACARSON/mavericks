    <p id="p2">On the night of February 1–2, 2025, three National Basketball Association <b>(NBA)</b> teams—the <u>Dallas Mavericks</u>, Los Angeles Lakers, 
      and <i>Utah Jazz</i>—concluded a blockbuster sports trade. The trade centered on <big>Mavericks</big> combo guard <code>Luka Dončić</code> and Lakers forward-center 
      Anthony Davis, <mark style="background-color:lightgreen">who were principally exchanged for each other.</mark> It was the first time in NBA history that two reigning All-NBA Team players 
      were traded for each other midseason.</p>

    <p>The luka and kyrie duo might have been the best duo to have ever walked the face of earth they were acc godly.</p>
    <p>The luka and kyrie duo has the greatest chemistry and its not even close but sadly because of nico harrison he stripped that away from all maverick fans</p>
    <p>Nico harrison might be the worst GM in nba history for th egregious move of trading away luka doncic to the lakers like how do you even think of something like that.</p>
      <pre id="lock">In the lockout-shortened 1998–99 season, the Mavericks finished with a lowly 19–31 record, 
        but Michael Finley and Gary Trent put up substantial numbers and led their team to their first winning home record (15–10) since 1989–90. Notable were the acquisitions of power 
        forward Dirk Nowitzki and point guard Steve Nash, two seemingly unspectacular moves that would significantly impact the future. In the following season, the team finally "clicked" 
        and started to win consistently. Led by Finley, the Mavericks earned their first 40-win season since 1989–90. He was much helped by Nowitzki, who finally "arrived" in the NBA and established 
        himself as a potent offensive threat.
      </pre>
      <pre class="2011">The 2011–12 season was shortened to 66 games due to a lockout, which meant the Mavericks had to wait until Christmas Day to raise their first championship banner. 
        During the brief off-season, owner Mark Cuban decided to maintain financial flexibility by letting Tyson Chandler, DeShawn Stevenson, J.J. Barea, and Caron Butler go. Chandler 
        signed with the New York Knicks, Stevenson joined the New Jersey Nets, Barea went to the Minnesota Timberwolves, and Butler joined the Los Angeles Clippers. Meanwhile, they 
        acquired incumbent Sixth Man of the Year Lamar Odom via a trade with the Lakers, while signing veterans Vince Carter and Delonte West.
      </pre>
   <pre class="2012">During the 2012 off-season, the Mavericks lost both Jason Kidd and Jason Terry to free agency. 
     Kidd signed with the New York Knicks, while Terry joined the Boston Celtics. Brendan Haywood was later amnestied before moving to the Charlotte Bobcats. 
     The Mavericks acquired Darren Collison from the Indiana Pacers and signed O. J. Mayo from the Memphis Grizzlies. Also joining the team were former 
     All-Stars Chris Kaman and Elton Brand.
   </pre>
<pre class="2013">The 2012–13 season was a struggle for the Mavericks, as Nowitzki recovered from knee surgery and missed 29 games. Also, Collison was inexperienced
  at the point, leading the Mavericks to sign veteran Derek Fisher for nine games,[41] before settling on Mike James. Mayo was the team's leading scorer for the
  first two months of the season before Nowitzki's return saw his averages dip. Injuries also hounded Kaman and Brand. The Mavericks were 23–29 at the All-Star break, 
  before making a late push for a playoff berth. Still, it did not save their season, and the Mavericks missed the playoffs for the first time since 2000.
